# Loan-Prediction

Hello there!

Welcome to my Github repository for loan prediction using logistic regression and random forest. This project is aimed at predicting whether or not a loan will be approved based on various features of the borrower, such as their income, credit score, and loan amount.

In this project, I have used two popular machine learning algorithms, logistic regression and random forest, to predict the loan approval status. The dataset used in this project is taken from Kaggle, and it contains information on past loan applications, including whether the loan was approved or not.

In this repository, you will find the following files:

loan_prediction_logistic_regression.ipynb - a Jupyter notebook containing the code for implementing logistic regression and random forest to predict loan approval status.

loan_data.csv - the dataset used in this project (it is not an open source because i got it from a financial institution).

README.md - this file you are currently reading.

To run this project on your machine, you will need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Once you have the necessary libraries installed, simply download the repository and open the Jupyter notebooks to see the code and run the project.

I hope you find this project informative and useful. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me via henrymessi3477@gmail.com.
